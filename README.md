## Mathpy
Just storing some scripts for making my life as a hs math teacher easier

### circleMaker.py
Given a pair of coordinates for the center of a circle, outputs any points
with integer coordinate values that land on the circumference of the circle,
that are not on the same vertal or horizontal line as the center.

### circleMaker.hs
Same task as circleMaker.py, just in Haskell, and recursive. Still poking around
to see if I can improve this in some way.

### isPrime.py
A little exploration into various ways to check for primeness in Python.

### isPrime.hs
Same idea, but in Haskell. `myPrime` with the `foldl` is one of my favorite 
Haskell functions I've ever written.

### secrets.py
A file containing four "secret" recursive functions, for students to try to
understand when they're learning about recursion for the first time.
